# TAMU FOODS
---
This is an e-Commerce food delivery web-based application that enables users to order food online from our partner range of restaurants and individual vendors.

A sequel and beta version of [Tamu-Foods](https://github.com/John-Kimani/Tamu-Foods-BackEnd.git) that I had earlier made with the Flask framework and alpha version of [TamuFoods](https://github.com/John-Kimani/tamufoods_react_redux_express.git) I recently revamped using React, Redux and Node express.
